## Work Experience

### Automation technician

I had a great honor to work with amazing people and get an amazing skillset. I worked as a part of the maintenace team. Learned bunch of stuff and got various skills. I had the opportunity to work with ABB robots, Siemens PLCs and lots of top tier machines, starting from CNCs, welding applications, glueing, sealing, deburring. Having the freedom to explore the limits of each of those machines, and learn the way that those behave was an amazing experience.
