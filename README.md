## About Me

### Hi there 👋

**Student Major: Informatics and Computer Science Engineering**
Faculty of Information Sciences and Computer Engineering, Skopje

As a student at FISCE, I have gained a strong foundation in software development, exploring structural programming concepts through languages such as C, C++, Java, and Python. I have also acquired skills in web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery. Additionally, I am familiar with the JUnit testing framework and Selenium WebDriver.

I completed a month-long course on Ladder Logic in Mitsubishi's GXWorks, expanding my knowledge of industrial automation.

In my current role, I have had the opportunity to work with the Apache Tapestry framework (version 5.3.8) and Kotlin. For issue tracking and backlog management, I utilize a local Redmine instance, while version control is handled through a local GitLab instance.
